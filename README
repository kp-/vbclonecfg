A little script to setup newly cloned VirtualBox images.

After makeing a clone of my base CentOS 6 install I use this script to 
help configure the newly cloned VM.

As of now the script does the following:

-- Configures the new initialized MAC address to be eth0
-- Asks and sets a new hostname
-- Sets the coorrect MAC address for ifcfg-eth0 

-kp
